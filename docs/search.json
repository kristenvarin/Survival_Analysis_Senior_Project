The survival package in R has a function called Surv() that takes input data and creates a response object recording survival time for each observation. The survfit() function can be used to calculate the Kaplan Meier survival estimate for each time that a new event occurs. This object can then be used for the response in the regression functionSurvfit2() in the ggsurvfit package, which plots the Kaplan Meier curve for the data. The function takes into account right censoring as well, marking censored times with a \\(+\\) symbol in the object created and then editing the regression accordingly (Zabor, E). A new data set with censored times will be created to demonstrate this process. To do this, a 0 will be recorded for some individuals at times before t = 10.\n\n# Load Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggsurvfit)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n# Create data set\nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\ntime &lt;- c(1, 2, 10, 4, 5, 6, 10, 8, 9, 10)\nstatus &lt;- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)\ncensor &lt;- data.frame(id, time, status)\n\n\n# View the Data Set with censored times\n#| label: tbl-censor\n#| tbl-cap: \"Example Data Set with Censored Times\"\n\ncensor %&gt;% gt(caption = \"Example Data Set with Censored Times\") %&gt;%\n  cols_label(id = \"ID\", time = \"Time\", status = \"Status\") %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(source_note = \"Table 3\") \n\n\n\n\n\n  Example Data Set with Censored Times\n  \n    \n    \n      ID\n      Time\n      Status\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n1\n1\n    2\n2\n1\n    3\n10\n0\n    4\n4\n0\n    5\n5\n1\n    6\n6\n0\n    7\n10\n0\n    8\n8\n1\n    9\n9\n1\n    10\n10\n0\n  \n  \n    \n      Table 3\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nsee ?tbl-censor\n\n# Surv() Function shows the time of event or censored time for each observation\ntimes2 &lt;- Surv(censor$time, censor$status)\ntimes2\n\n [1]  1   2  10+  4+  5   6+ 10+  8   9  10+\n\n\n\n# Calculate survival object\ns2 &lt;- survfit(times2 ~ 1, data = censor)\n# See the structure of this object\nstr(s2)\n\nList of 16\n $ n        : int 10\n $ time     : num [1:8] 1 2 4 5 6 8 9 10\n $ n.risk   : num [1:8] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3\n $ n.event  : num [1:8] 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0\n $ n.censor : num [1:8] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 3\n $ surv     : num [1:8] 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.686 0.686 ...\n $ std.err  : num [1:8] 0.105 0.158 0.158 0.221 0.221 ...\n $ cumhaz   : num [1:8] 0.1 0.211 0.211 0.354 0.354 ...\n $ std.chaz : num [1:8] 0.1 0.149 0.149 0.207 0.207 ...\n $ type     : chr \"right\"\n $ logse    : logi TRUE\n $ conf.int : num 0.95\n $ conf.type: chr \"log\"\n $ lower    : num [1:8] 0.732 0.587 0.587 0.445 0.445 ...\n $ upper    : num [1:8] 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ call     : language survfit(formula = times2 ~ 1, data = censor)\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"survfit\"\n\n\n\n# View the survival estimate for each time an event occurs\ns2$time\n\n[1]  1  2  4  5  6  8  9 10\n\nround(s2$surv, 2)\n\n[1] 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.69 0.69 0.55 0.41 0.41\n\n\n\n# Plot the survival curve\n#| label: fig-survcurv\n#| tbl-cap: \"Kaplan Meier Survival Curve\"\n\nsurvfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = censor) %&gt;% \n  ggsurvfit() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Time\",\n    y = \"Overall survival probability\",\n    title = \"Kaplan Meier Survival Curve\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,by=2)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.2)) +\n  add_risktable()\n\n\n\n\nsee ?fig-survcurv"

    "text": "1.1 Survival Analysis Background\nSurvival analysis is a type of statistical analysis used for analyzing the relationship between time and an event of interest occurring for individuals. The name survival analysis implies that the most common outcome analyzed is death, but many other events can be analyzed including: time it takes to begin recovering from treatment or time until a disease is contracted. These analyses are specifically helpful when comparing groups of people such as treatment groups in a clinical trial. Survival analysis can reveal whether certain treatments are more effective than others in helping individuals to live longer or avoid certain outcomes of interest, such as heart attacks."

    "text": "1.2 Example dataset in R\nTo demonstrate survival analysis, an example dataset was created including ten observations and a time variable ranging from one to ten. Each observation was either assigned a 1, which represented the event occurrence, or a 0, representing no event occurrence. For those assigned a 1, a survival time was assigned in the range of 1 to 9. For those assigned a 0, a time of 10 was assigned, representing the end of the hypothetical study. To create a survival curve, the following steps need to be taken: finding the probability of survival at each time from 0 to 10 and plotting each point must be plotted on a graph. For the first point, probability of survival is always a 1 because every participant begins the study alive. For the first point in the dataset, the observation was assigned a 1 at time 1. When an individual experiences the outcome of interest, the total probability of survival for the group decreases, which is why survival curves have a rightly skewed distribution. The probability of surviving to time 1 would be the number of participants that did not experience the outcome divided by the total number of participants in the study, which would be nine participants divided by 10 subjects, or 0.9. After calculating the probability for each point in a similar way, the survival curve can be graphed (Figure 1). Summary statistics can also be calculated for these values.\nTable walking through the example probabilities here"

    "section": "1.3 Censoring Background",
    "text": "1.3 Censoring Background\nOne issue with survival analysis data is the problem of an individual being lost-to-follow-up, meaning data could not be collected for them at some point during the study. This causes the outcome of interest to not be recorded for that individual, so the survival time for that individual can not be analyzed as it would not be accurate. When this happens, the survival times for those individuals are recorded as censored, causing standard analysis techniques to be inappropriate for these data. There are three types of censoring that can occur. The first type of censoring is called right censoring, which happens if an individual begins the study but then is lost-to-follow-up at some point during the study before it ends. The censored survival time for these individuals is thus equal to the total time they were known to be alive in the study’s observation period before they were lost-to-follow-up. Some common examples of when right censoring is needed include: an individual moving away from the study and not being able to participate or when an individual dies due to a non-related event after the study begins. Another type of censoring is called left censoring. In this type, the individual experiences lost-to-follow-up before the observation period begins. This would happen, for example, in a study that tracks patient recovery from a surgery, but with an observation period beginning one a month after the surgery took place. If a patient died less than a month after surgery, their survival time would need to be left censored. The final type of censoring is called interval censoring, which happens when a patient comes in and out of the study, making it possible for them to experience the outcome of interest during a period of time when they aren’t being observed. This often happens when recurrence is being tracked in a study. One example could be if recurrence of cancer is being tracked and the study checks in with patients every month. If an individual does not have cancer after the first month but then does after the second month, the recurrence time is somewhere between one and two months, and it therefore needs to be interval censored (). Out of the three types, right censoring is the most common and will be demonstrated in the example data-set."

The Kaplan Meier survival estimate is used to calculate probability of survival at a given time where \\(S(t_j)\\) is the probability of being alive at time \\(t_j\\), \\(S(t_{j-1})\\) is the probability of being alive at \\(t_{j-1}\\), \\(n_j\\) is the number of patients alive just before \\(t_j\\), \\(d_j\\) is the number of events at \\(t_j\\), and \\(j\\) is the time interval of interest. The equation is \\(S(t_j)=S(t\\_{j-1})(1-\\frac{d_j}{n_j})\\) (Clark et al.). The equation essentially divides the surviving individuals by the individuals at risk, similar to the previous calculations shown. However, Kaplan Meier curves adjust for right-censored times by dropping observations from the total number of individuals at risk, \\(n_j\\), after their censored time has been reached. This adjustment prevents overestimating the survival probability because it no longer assumes censored individuals are still alive or and at risk (Goel et al)."

One example of this might be if a study is comparing survival after two different treatment plans. The Log-Rank Test is a statistical test that tests the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the survival estimates of two groups at any point in time (Rich et al.).

    "text": "1.2 Example data set in R\nTo demonstrate survival analysis, an example data set was created including ten observations with the following columns: a. \\(id\\) variable for each observation, a \\(time\\) variable ranging from 1 to 10, and a \\(status\\) variable that was either a 1, which represented the event occurrence, or a 0, representing no event occurrence. For those assigned a 1, a survival time was assigned in the range of 1 to 9, representing the time that individual survived until the event occurred for them. For those assigned a 0, a time of t = 10 was assigned, suggesting that they lasted until the end of the hypothetical study without the event occurring. Table 1.1 shows these data. To perform survival analysis on these data, the probability of survival at each time from t = 0 to t = 10 can be calculated by dividing the amount of people surviving until that time by the total amount of people in the study. For the first observation in the example data, probability of survival is equal to 1, or 100%, because every participant would presumably begin the study alive. To calculate the probability of survival for time t = 1, the number of participants that did not experience the outcome of interest by t = 1 would be divided by 10, the total number of observations in the study. In this case, 9 participants survived until time t = 1, because only one observation was assigned a 1 between times t = 0 and t = 1. Dividing this total by the 10 total observations in the study shows that the probability of surviving to time 1 is 0.9, or 90%. As time increases, the total probability of survival for the group will decrease in the range of 1 to 0 because more people will be experiencing the outcome. This is why survival curves have a rightly skewed distribution.

The function takes into account right censoring as well, marking censored times with a \\(+\\) symbol in the object created and then editing the regression accordingly (Zabor (2023)). A new data set with censored times will be created to demonstrate this process. To do this, a 0 will be recorded for some individuals at times before t = 10.\n\n# Load Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggsurvfit)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n# Create data set\nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\ntime &lt;- c(1, 2, 10, 4, 5, 6, 10, 8, 9, 10)\nstatus &lt;- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)\ncensor &lt;- data.frame(id, time, status)\n\n\ncensor %&gt;% gt(caption = \"Example Data Set with Censored Times\") %&gt;%\n  cols_label(id = \"ID\", time = \"Time\", status = \"Status\") %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(source_note = \"Table 3\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Table 2.1:  Example Data Set with Censored Times \n  \n    \n    \n      ID\n      Time\n      Status\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n1\n1\n    2\n2\n1\n    3\n10\n0\n    4\n4\n0\n    5\n5\n1\n    6\n6\n0\n    7\n10\n0\n    8\n8\n1\n    9\n9\n1\n    10\n10\n0\n  \n  \n    \n      Table 3\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1\n\n# Surv() Function shows the time of event or censored time for each observation\ntimes2 &lt;- Surv(censor$time, censor$status)\ntimes2\n\n [1]  1   2  10+  4+  5   6+ 10+  8   9  10+\n\n\n\n# Calculate survival object\ns2 &lt;- survfit(times2 ~ 1, data = censor)\n# See the structure of this object\nstr(s2)\n\nList of 16\n $ n        : int 10\n $ time     : num [1:8] 1 2 4 5 6 8 9 10\n $ n.risk   : num [1:8] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3\n $ n.event  : num [1:8] 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0\n $ n.censor : num [1:8] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 3\n $ surv     : num [1:8] 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.686 0.686 ...\n $ std.err  : num [1:8] 0.105 0.158 0.158 0.221 0.221 ...\n $ cumhaz   : num [1:8] 0.1 0.211 0.211 0.354 0.354 ...\n $ std.chaz : num [1:8] 0.1 0.149 0.149 0.207 0.207 ...\n $ type     : chr \"right\"\n $ logse    : logi TRUE\n $ conf.int : num 0.95\n $ conf.type: chr \"log\"\n $ lower    : num [1:8] 0.732 0.587 0.587 0.445 0.445 ...\n $ upper    : num [1:8] 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ call     : language survfit(formula = times2 ~ 1, data = censor)\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"survfit\"\n\n\n\n# View the survival estimate for each time an event occurs\ns2$time\n\n[1]  1  2  4  5  6  8  9 10\n\nround(s2$surv, 2)\n\n[1] 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.69 0.69 0.55 0.41 0.41\n\n\n\nsurvfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = censor) %&gt;% \n  ggsurvfit() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Time\",\n    y = \"Overall survival probability\",\n    title = \"Kaplan Meier Survival Curve\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,by=2)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.2)) +\n  add_risktable()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1"

    "text": "2.4 Log-Rank Test\nOne of the most common applications of survival analysis and Kaplan Meier curves is for comparing survival statistics between two groups. One example of this might be if a study is comparing survival after two different treatment plans. The Log-Rank Test is a statistical test that tests the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the survival estimates of two groups at any point in time (Rich (2010)). The only adjustment needed in R to factor in groups is to use the grouping variable as a predictor in the model (Zabor (2023)).\n\n# Create a data set to compare to surv2\nid &lt;- c(1:20)\ntime &lt;- c(8, 7, 10, 8, 5, 10, 10, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 10, 8, 1)\nstatus &lt;- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)\ngroup &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ,2 ,2, 2, 2)\nsurv3 &lt;- data.frame(id, time, status)\n\nThe survdiff function works similarly to the survfit function, but compares groups.
